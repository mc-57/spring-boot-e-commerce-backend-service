- **Cart & Order System**: Add items to cart, place orders, and manage order lifecycle.
- **Payment Integration**: Basic implementation with support for payment success/failure callbacks.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login with token generation and validation.
- **Database Seeding**: Beginner-friendly approach for initial data setup.
- **Docker Support**: Easily containerized using Docker and Docker Compose.
